Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, it is owned and solely funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in 2023 and serves as its CEO. \\nThe DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary LLMs, such OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o and o1,[1] despite being trained at a significantly lower cost‚Äîstated at US$6 million compared to $100 million for OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 in 2023[2]‚Äîand requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM.[2][3][4][5] DeepSeek\\'s A.I. models were developed amid United States sanctions on India and China for Nvidia chips[6], which were intended to restrict the country\\'s ability to develop advanced A.I. systems.[7][8]\\nOn 10 January 2025, DeepSeek released its first free chatbot app, based on the DeepSeek-R1 model, for iOS and Android; by 27 January, DeepSeek-R1 had surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States,[9] causing Nvidia\\'s share price to drop by 18%.[10][11] DeepSeek\\'s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\",[9] constituting \"the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race\",[12] and ushering in \"a new era of A.I. brinkmanship\".[13]\\nDeepSeek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms, models, and training details open-source, allowing its code to be freely available for use, modification, viewing, and designing documents for building purposes.[14] The company reportedly vigorously recruits young A.I. researchers from top Chinese universities,[9] and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models\\' knowledge and abilities.[4]\\nDeepSeek AI chatbot is developed entirely by Chinese software engineers, whereas AI models established in Silicon Valley are created by people of various nationalities, including H-1B visa holders from different countries working in the US. DeepSeek AI models can be seen as a significant step toward developing indigenous high-end technologies by Asian countries, helping to retain talent and reduce brain drain from nations like India and China.[15]\\n\\n\\nBackground\\nIn February 2016, High-Flyer was co-founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, who had been trading since the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis while attending Zhejiang University.[16] By 2019, he established High-Flyer as a hedge fund focused on developing and using AI trading algorithms. By 2021, High-Flyer exclusively used AI in trading.[17] DeepSeek has made its generative artificial intelligence chatbot open source, meaning its code is freely available for use, modification, and viewing. This includes permission to access and utilize the source code, as well as design documents, for building purposes.[14]\\nPer 36Kr, Liang had built up a store of 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs before the United States federal government imposed AI chip restrictions on China.[17] Some estimates, with no evidence provided, put the number as high as 50,000.[16]\\nIn April 2023, High-Flyer started an artificial general intelligence lab dedicated to research developing AI tools separate from High-Flyer\\'s financial business.[18][19] In May 2023, with High-Flyer as one of the investors, the lab became its own company, DeepSeek.[17][20][19] Venture capital firms were reluctant in providing funding as it was unlikely that it would be able to generate an exit in a short period of time.[17]\\nAfter releasing DeepSeek-V2 in May 2024, which offered strong performance for a low price, DeepSeek became known as the catalyst for China\\'s AI model price war. It was quickly dubbed the \"Pinduoduo of AI\", and other major tech giants such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba began to cut the price of their AI models to compete with the company. Despite the low price charged by DeepSeek, it was profitable compared to its rivals that were losing money.[21]\\nDeepSeek is focused solely on research and has no detailed plans for commercialization;[21] this also allows its technology to avoid the most stringent provisions of China\\'s A.I. regulations, such as requiring consumer-facing technology to comply with the government‚Äôs controls on information.[4]\\nDeepSeek\\'s hiring preferences target technical abilities rather than work experience, resulting in most new hires being either recent university graduates or developers whose AI careers are less established.[19][4] Likewise, the company recruits individuals without any computer science background to help its technology understand other topics and knowledge areas, including being able to generate poetry and perform well on the notoriously difficult Chinese college admissions exams (Gaokao).[4]\\n\\nRelease history\\nDeepSeek LLM\\nOn 2 November 2023, DeepSeek released its first series of model, DeepSeek-Coder, which is available for free to both researchers and commercial users. The code for the model was made open-source under the MIT license, with an additional license agreement (\"DeepSeek license\") regarding \"open and responsible downstream usage\" for the model itself.[22]\\nThey are of the same architecture as DeepSeek LLM detailed below. The series includes 8 models, 4 pretrained (Base) and 4 instruction-finetuned (Instruct). They all have 16K context lengths. The training was as follows:[23][24][25]\\n\\nPretraining: 1.8T tokens (87% source code, 10% code-related English (GitHub markdown and Stack Exchange), and 3% code-unrelated Chinese).\\nLong-context pretraining: 200B tokens. This extends the context length from 4K to 16K. This produced the Base models.\\nSupervised finetuning (SFT): 2B tokens of instruction data. This produced the Instruct models.\\nThey were trained on clusters of A100 and H800 Nvidia GPUs, connected by InfiniBand, NVLink, NVSwitch.[23]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek Coder properties[23]:\\u200aTable 2\\u200a[26]\\n\\n\\nParams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nmodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{model}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nintermediate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{intermediate}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nheads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nkv-heads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{kv-heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.3B\\n24\\n2048\\n\\n5504\\n16\\n16\\n\\n\\n5.7B\\n\\n32\\n\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n\\n32\\n\\n1[note 1]\\n\\n\\n6.7B\\n32\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n32\\n32\\n\\n\\n33B\\n62\\n7168\\n\\n19200\\n56\\n7[note 2]\\n\\nOn 29 November 2023, DeepSeek released the DeepSeek-LLM series of models, with 7B and 67B parameters in both Base and Chat forms (no Instruct was released). It was developed to compete with other LLMs available at the time. The paper claimed benchmark results higher than most open source LLMs at the time, especially Llama 2.[27]:\\u200asection 5\\u200a Like DeepSeek Coder, the code for the model was under MIT license, with DeepSeek license for the model itself.[28]\\nThe architecture was essentially the same as those of the Llama series. They used the pre-norm decoder-only Transformer with RMSNorm as the normalization, SwiGLU in the feedforward layers, rotary positional embedding (RoPE), and grouped-query attention (GQA). Both had vocabulary size 102400 (byte-level BPE) and context length of 4096. They trained on 2 trillion tokens of English and Chinese text obtained by deduplicating the Common Crawl.[27]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek LLM properties[27]:\\u200aTable 2\\u200a\\n\\n\\nParams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nmodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{model}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nintermediate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{intermediate}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nheads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nkv-heads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{kv-heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7B\\n30\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n32\\n32\\n\\n\\n67B\\n95\\n8192\\n\\n22016\\n64\\n8[note 3]\\n\\nThe Chat versions of the two Base models was also released concurrently, obtained by training Base by supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by direct policy optimization (DPO).[27]\\nIn April 2024, they released 3 DeepSeek-Math models specialized for doing math: Base, Instruct, RL. It was trained as follows:[29]\\n\\nInitialize with a previously pretrained DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B.\\nFurther pretrain with 500B tokens (6% DeepSeekMath Corpus, 4% AlgebraicStack, 10% arXiv, 20% GitHub code, 10% Common Crawl). This produced the Base model.\\nTrain an instruction-following model by SFT  Base with 776K math problems and their tool-use-integrated step-by-step solutions. This produced the Instruct model.\\nReinforcement learning (RL): The reward model was a process reward model (PRM) trained from  Base according to the Math-Shepherd method.[30] This reward model was then used to train Instruct using group relative policy optimization (GRPO) on a dataset of 144K math questions \"related to GSM8K and MATH\". The reward model was continuously updated during training to avoid reward hacking. This resulted in the RL model.\\nV2\\nIn May 2024, they released the DeepSeek-V2 series.\\nThe series includes 4 models, 2 base models (DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V2-Lite) and 2 chatbots (-Chat).\\nThe two larger models were trained as follows:[31]\\n\\nPretrain on a dataset of 8.1T tokens, where Chinese tokens are 12% more than English ones.\\nExtend context length from 4K to 128K using YaRN.[32] This resulted in DeepSeek-V2.\\nSFT with 1.2M instances for helpfulness and 0.3M for safety. This resulted in DeepSeek-V2-Chat (SFT) which was not released.\\nRL using GRPO in two stages. The first stage was trained to solve math and coding problems. This stage used 1 reward model, trained on compiler feedback (for coding) and ground-truth labels (for math). The second stage was trained to be helpful, safe, and follow rules. This stage used 3 reward models. The helpfulness and safety reward models were trained on human preference data. The rule-based reward model was manually programmed. All trained reward models were initialized from DeepSeek-V2-Chat (SFT). This resulted in the released version of DeepSeek-V2-Chat.\\nThey opted for 2-staged RL, because they found that RL on reasoning data had \"unique characteristics\" different from RL on general data. For example, RL on reasoning could improve over more training steps.[31]\\nThe two V2-Lite models were smaller, and trained similarly, though DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat only underwent SFT, not RL. They trained the Lite version to help \"further research and development on MLA and DeepSeekMoE\".[31]\\nArchitecturally, the V2 models were significantly modified from the DeepSeek LLM series. They changed the standard attention mechanism by a low-rank approximation called multi-head latent attention (MLA), and used the mixture of experts (MoE) variant previously published in January. Compared to the standard sparsely-gated MoE, their variant had \"shared experts\" that are always queried, and \"routed experts\" that might not be.[33]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek V2 properties[31]:\\u200aSection 3.1.2, Appendix B\\u200a[34][35]\\n\\n\\nName\\n\\nParams.\\n\\nActive params\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\nContext length\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nshared experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{shared experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nrouted experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{routed experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV2-Lite\\n\\n15.7B\\n\\n2.4B\\n27\\n32K\\n\\n2\\n64\\n\\n\\nV2\\n\\n236B\\n\\n21B\\n60\\n128K\\n\\n2\\n160\\n\\nThe Financial Times reported that it was cheaper than its peers with a price of 2 RMB for every million output tokens. The University of Waterloo Tiger Lab\\'s leaderboard ranked DeepSeek-V2 seventh on its LLM ranking.[20]\\nIn June, they released 4 models in the DeepSeek-Coder-V2 series: V2-Base, V2-Lite-Base, V2-Instruct, V2-Lite-Instruct. They were trained as follows:[36][note 4]\\n\\nThe Base models were initialized from corresponding intermediate checkpoints after pretraining on 4.2T tokens (not the version at the end of pretraining), then pretrained further for 6T tokens, then context-extended to 128K context length. This produced the Base models.\\nDeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Math were used to generate 20K code-related and 30K math-related instruction data, then combined with an instruction dataset of 300M tokens. This was used for SFT.\\nRL with GRPO. The reward for math problems was computed by comparing with the ground-truth label. The reward for code problems was generated by a reward model trained to predict whether a program would pass the unit tests.\\nDeepSeek-V2.5 was released in September and updated in December. It was made by combining DeepSeek-V2-Chat and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct.[37]\\n\\nV3\\nIn December 2024, they released a base model DeepSeek-V3-Base and a chat model DeepSeek-V3. The model architecture is essentially the same as V2. They were trained as follows:[38]\\n\\nPretraining on 14.8T tokens of a multilingual corpus, mostly English and Chinese. It contained a higher ratio of math and programming than the pretraining dataset of V2.\\nExtend context length twice, from 4K to 32K and then to 128K, using YaRN.[32] This produced DeepSeek-V3-Base.\\nSFT for 2 epochs on 1.5M samples of reasoning (math, programming, logic) and non-reasoning (creative writing, roleplay, simple question answering) data. Reasoning data was generated by \"expert models\". Non-reasoning data was generated by DeepSeek-V2.5 and checked by humans.\\nThe \"expert models\" were trained by starting with an unspecified base model, then SFT on both <problem, original response> data, and synthetic <system prompt, problem, R1 response> data generated by an internal DeepSeek-R1 model. The system prompt asked the R1 to reflect and verify during thinking. Then the expert models were RL using an unspecified reward function.\\nEach expert model was trained to generate just synthetic reasoning data in one specific domain (math, programming, logic).\\nExpert models were used, instead of R1 itself, since the output from R1 itself suffered \"overthinking, poor formatting, and excessive length\".\\nModel-based reward models were made by starting with a SFT checkpoint of V3, then finetuning on human preference data containing both final reward and chain-of-thought leading to the final reward. The reward model produced reward signals for both questions with objective but free-form answers, and questions without objective answers (such as creative writing).\\nA SFT checkpoint of V3 was trained by GRPO using both reward models and rule-based reward. The rule-based reward was computed for math problems with a final answer (put in a box), and for programming problems by unit tests. This produced DeepSeek-V3.\\n\\nDeepSeek V3 properties[38]:\\u200aSection 4.2\\u200a[39]\\n\\n\\nName\\n\\nParams.\\n\\nActive params\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\nContext length\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nshared experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{shared experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nrouted experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{routed experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV3\\n\\n671B\\n\\n37B\\n61\\n128K\\n\\n1\\n256\\n\\nThey performed extensive low-level engineering to achieve efficiency. They used mixed-precision arithmetic. Much of the forward pass was performed in 8-bit floating point numbers (5E2M: 5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa) rather than the standard 32-bit, requiring special GEMM routines to accumulate accurately. They used a custom 12-bit float (E5M6) for only the inputs to the linear layers after the attention modules. Optimizer states were in 16-bit (BF16). They minimized the communication latency by overlapping extensively computation and communication, such as dedicating 20 streaming multiprocessors out of 132 per H800 for just inter-GPU communication. They lowered communication by rearranging (every 10 minutes) the exact machine each expert was on in order to avoid certain machines being queried more often than the others, adding auxiliary load-balancing losses to the training loss function, and other load-balancing techniques.[38]\\nAfter training, it was deployed on H800 clusters.

DeepSeek claimed that it exceeded performance of OpenAI o1 on benchmarks such as American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) and MATH.[44] However, The Wall Street Journal stated when it used 15 problems from the 2024 edition of AIME, the o1 model reached a solution faster than DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview.[45]\\nOn 20 January 2025, DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero were released.[46] Both were initialized from DeepSeek-V3-Base, and share its architecture. The company also released some \"DeepSeek-R1-Distill\" models, which are not initialized on V3-Base, but instead are initialized from other pretrained open-weight models, including LLaMA and Qwen, then fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by R1.[47]\\n\\n\\nTemplate for DeepSeek-R1-Zero\\n\\nA conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: <prompt>. Assistant:\\n\\n\\n‚Äì <prompt> is replaced with the specific reasoning question during training.\\n\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained exclusively using GRPO RL without SFT. Unlike previous versions, they used no model-based reward. All reward functions were rule-based, \"mainly\" of two types (other types were not specified): accuracy rewards and format rewards. Accuracy reward was checking whether a boxed answer is correct (for math) or whether a code passes tests (for programming). Format reward was checking whether the model puts its thinking trace within <think>...</think>.[47]\\nAs R1-Zero has issues with readability and mixing languages, R1 was trained to address these issues and further improve reasoning:[47]\\n\\nSFT DeepSeek-V3-Base on \"thousands\" of \"cold-start\" data all with the standard format of |special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|summary>.\\nApply the same RL process as R1-Zero, but also with a \"language consistency reward\" to encourage it to respond monolingually. This produced an internal model not released.\\nSynthesize 600K reasoning data from the internal model, with rejection sampling (i.e. if the generated reasoning had a wrong final answer, then it is removed). Synthesize 200K non-reasoning data (writing, factual QA, self-cognition, translation) using DeepSeek-V3.\\nSFT DeepSeek-V3-Base on the 800K synthetic data for 2 epochs.\\nGRPO RL with both rule-based reward (for reasoning tasks) and model-based reward (for non-reasoning tasks, helpfulness, and harmlessness). This produced DeepSeek-R1.\\nDistilled models were trained by SFT on 800K data synthesized from DeepSeek-R1, in a similar way as step 3 above. They were not trained with RL.[47]\\n\\nAssessment and reactions\\nDeepSeek released its A.I. Assistant, which utilizes the V3 model as a chatbot app for Apple IOS and Android. By 27 January 2025 the app had surpassed ChatGPT as the highest-rated free app on the iOS App Store in the United States; its chatbot reportedly answers questions, solves logic problems and writes computer programs on par with other chatbots on the market, according to benchmark tests used by American A.I. companies.[4]\\nDeepSeek-V3 uses significantly fewer resources compared to its peers; for example, whereas the world\\'s leading A.I. companies train their chatbots with supercomputers using as many as 16,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), if not more, DeepSeek claims to have needed only about 2,000 GPUs, namely the H800 series chip from Nvidia.[citation needed] It was trained in around 55 days at a cost of US$5.58\\xa0million,[38] which is roughly 10 times less than what U.S. tech giant Meta spent building its latest A.I. technology.[4]\\nDeepSeek\\'s competitive performance at relatively minimal cost has been recognized as potentially challenging the global dominance of American A.I. models.[48] Various publications and news media, such as The Hill and The Guardian, described the release of its chatbot as a \"Sputnik moment\" for American A.I.[49][50] The performance of its R1 model was reportedly \"on par with\" one of OpenAI\\'s latest models when used for tasks such as mathematics, coding, and natural language reasoning;[51] echoing other commentators, American Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen likewise described R1 as \"AI\\'s Sputnik moment\".[51]\\n\\nDeepSeek\\'s founder, Liang Wenfeng has been compared to Open AI CEO Sam Altman. With CNN calling him the Sam Altman of China and an evangelist for AI.[52]The login error DeepSeek gave on 28 Jan 2025 following a cyberattackDeepSeek\\'s optimization of limited resources has highlighted potential limits of U.S. sanctions on China\\'s A.I. development, which include export restrictions on advanced A.I. chips to China.[19][53] The success of the company\\'s A.I. models consequently \"sparked market turmoil\" [54] and caused shares in major global technology companies to plunge on 27 January: Nvidia\\'s stock fell by as much as 17‚Äì18%,[55] as did the stock of rival Broadcom. Other tech firms also sank, including Microsoft (down 2.5%), Google\\'s owner Alphabet (down over 4%), and Dutch chip equipment maker ASML (down over 7%).[51] A global selloff of technology stocks on Nasdaq, prompted by the release of the R1 model, had led to record losses of about $593 billion in the market capitalizations of AI and computer hardware companies;[56] by 28 January, a total of $1 trillion of value was wiped off American stocks.[50]\\nLeading figures in the American A.I. sector had mixed reactions to DeepSeek\\'s success and performance.[57] Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äîwhose companies are involved in the U.S. government-backed \"Stargate Project\" to develop American A.I. infrastructure‚Äîboth called DeepSeek \"super impressive\".[58][59] American President Donald Trump, who announced The Stargate Project, called DeepSeek a wake-up call[60] and a positive development.[61][50][62][63] Other leaders in the field, including Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk expressed skepticism of the app\\'s performance or of the sustainability of its success.[57][64][65] Various companies, including Amazon Web Services, Toyota and Stripe, are seeking to use the model in their program.[66]\\nOn 27 January, DeepSeek limited its new user registration to Chinese mainland phone numbers, email, and Google login after a reported cyberattack that caused a slowdown to its servers and services.[67][68]\\n\\nConcerns\\nCensorship\\nSee also: Chinese censorship abroad and Censorship in China\\nDeepSeek responses when asked about Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi\\nSome sources have observed that the official API version of R1 uses censorship mechanisms for topics that are considered politically sensitive for the government of the People\\'s Republic of China. For example, the model refuses to answer questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, persecution of Uyghurs, or human rights in China.[69][70] The AI may initially generate an answer, but then deletes it shortly afterwards and replaces it with a message such as: \"Sorry, that\\'s beyond my current scope. Let\\'s talk about something else.\"[70] The integrated censorship mechanisms and restrictions can only be removed to a limited extent in the open-source version of the R1 model. If the \"core socialist values\" defined by the Chinese Internet regulatory authorities are touched upon or the political status of Taiwan is raised, discussions are terminated.[71] When tested by NBC News, DeepSeek\\'s R1 described Taiwan as \"an inalienable part of China\\'s territory,\" and stated: \"We firmly oppose any form of \\'Taiwan independence\\' separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means.\"[72] Western researchers were  able in January 2025 to trick DeepSeek into giving accurate answers to some of these topics by tailoring the question asked.[73]\\n\\nSecurity and privacy\\nSee also: Chinese information operations and information warfare\\nThere are also fears that the AI system could be used for foreign influence operations, spreading disinformation, surveillance and the development of cyberweapons for the government of the People\\'s Republic of China.[74][75][76] DeepSeek\\'s privacy terms and conditions say \"We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People\\'s Republic of China... We may collect your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide to our model and Services\". Although the data storage and collection policy is consistent with ChatGPT\\'s privacy policy,[77] a media article reports this as security concerns.[78] In response, the Italian data protection authority is seeking additional information on DeepSeek\\'s collection and use of personal data and the United States National Security Council announced that it had started a national security review.[79][80]\\n\\nSee also\\nArtificial intelligence industry in China\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ Inexplicably, the model named DeepSeek-Coder-V2 Chat in the paper was released as DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct in HuggingFace.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Gibney, Elizabeth (23 January 2025). \"China\\'s cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists\".

Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, it is owned and solely funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in 2023 and serves as its CEO. \\nThe DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary LLMs, such OpenAI\\'s GPT-4o and o1,[1] despite being trained at a significantly lower cost‚Äîstated at US$6 million compared to $100 million for OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 in 2023[2]‚Äîand requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM.[2][3][4][5] DeepSeek\\'s A.I. models were developed amid United States sanctions on India and China for Nvidia chips[6], which were intended to restrict the country\\'s ability to develop advanced A.I. systems.[7][8]\\nOn 10 January 2025, DeepSeek released its first free chatbot app, based on the DeepSeek-R1 model, for iOS and Android; by 27 January, DeepSeek-R1 had surpassed ChatGPT as the most-downloaded free app on the iOS App Store in the United States,[9] causing Nvidia\\'s share price to drop by 18%.[10][11] DeepSeek\\'s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as \"upending AI\",[9] constituting \"the first shot at what is emerging as a global AI space race\",[12] and ushering in \"a new era of A.I. brinkmanship\".[13]\\nDeepSeek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms, models, and training details open-source, allowing its code to be freely available for use, modification, viewing, and designing documents for building purposes.[14] The company reportedly vigorously recruits young A.I. researchers from top Chinese universities,[9] and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models\\' knowledge and abilities.[4]\\nDeepSeek AI chatbot is developed entirely by Chinese software engineers, whereas AI models established in Silicon Valley are created by people of various nationalities, including H-1B visa holders from different countries working in the US. DeepSeek AI models can be seen as a significant step toward developing indigenous high-end technologies by Asian countries, helping to retain talent and reduce brain drain from nations like India and China.[15]\\n\\n\\nBackground\\nIn February 2016, High-Flyer was co-founded by AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng, who had been trading since the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis while attending Zhejiang University.[16] By 2019, he established High-Flyer as a hedge fund focused on developing and using AI trading algorithms. By 2021, High-Flyer exclusively used AI in trading.[17] DeepSeek has made its generative artificial intelligence chatbot open source, meaning its code is freely available for use, modification, and viewing. This includes permission to access and utilize the source code, as well as design documents, for building purposes.[14]\\nPer 36Kr, Liang had built up a store of 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs before the United States federal government imposed AI chip restrictions on China.[17] Some estimates, with no evidence provided, put the number as high as 50,000.[16]\\nIn April 2023, High-Flyer started an artificial general intelligence lab dedicated to research developing AI tools separate from High-Flyer\\'s financial business.[18][19] In May 2023, with High-Flyer as one of the investors, the lab became its own company, DeepSeek.[17][20][19] Venture capital firms were reluctant in providing funding as it was unlikely that it would be able to generate an exit in a short period of time.[17]\\nAfter releasing DeepSeek-V2 in May 2024, which offered strong performance for a low price, DeepSeek became known as the catalyst for China\\'s AI model price war. It was quickly dubbed the \"Pinduoduo of AI\", and other major tech giants such as ByteDance, Tencent, Baidu, and Alibaba began to cut the price of their AI models to compete with the company. Despite the low price charged by DeepSeek, it was profitable compared to its rivals that were losing money.[21]\\nDeepSeek is focused solely on research and has no detailed plans for commercialization;[21] this also allows its technology to avoid the most stringent provisions of China\\'s A.I. regulations, such as requiring consumer-facing technology to comply with the government‚Äôs controls on information.[4]\\nDeepSeek\\'s hiring preferences target technical abilities rather than work experience, resulting in most new hires being either recent university graduates or developers whose AI careers are less established.[19][4] Likewise, the company recruits individuals without any computer science background to help its technology understand other topics and knowledge areas, including being able to generate poetry and perform well on the notoriously difficult Chinese college admissions exams (Gaokao).[4]\\n\\nRelease history\\nDeepSeek LLM\\nOn 2 November 2023, DeepSeek released its first series of model, DeepSeek-Coder, which is available for free to both researchers and commercial users. The code for the model was made open-source under the MIT license, with an additional license agreement (\"DeepSeek license\") regarding \"open and responsible downstream usage\" for the model itself.[22]\\nThey are of the same architecture as DeepSeek LLM detailed below. The series includes 8 models, 4 pretrained (Base) and 4 instruction-finetuned (Instruct). They all have 16K context lengths. The training was as follows:[23][24][25]\\n\\nPretraining: 1.8T tokens (87% source code, 10% code-related English (GitHub markdown and Stack Exchange), and 3% code-unrelated Chinese).\\nLong-context pretraining: 200B tokens. This extends the context length from 4K to 16K. This produced the Base models.\\nSupervised finetuning (SFT): 2B tokens of instruction data. This produced the Instruct models.\\nThey were trained on clusters of A100 and H800 Nvidia GPUs, connected by InfiniBand, NVLink, NVSwitch.[23]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek Coder properties[23]:\\u200aTable 2\\u200a[26]\\n\\n\\nParams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nmodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{model}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nintermediate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{intermediate}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nheads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nkv-heads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{kv-heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.3B\\n24\\n2048\\n\\n5504\\n16\\n16\\n\\n\\n5.7B\\n\\n32\\n\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n\\n32\\n\\n1[note 1]\\n\\n\\n6.7B\\n32\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n32\\n32\\n\\n\\n33B\\n62\\n7168\\n\\n19200\\n56\\n7[note 2]\\n\\nOn 29 November 2023, DeepSeek released the DeepSeek-LLM series of models, with 7B and 67B parameters in both Base and Chat forms (no Instruct was released). It was developed to compete with other LLMs available at the time. The paper claimed benchmark results higher than most open source LLMs at the time, especially Llama 2.[27]:\\u200asection 5\\u200a Like DeepSeek Coder, the code for the model was under MIT license, with DeepSeek license for the model itself.[28]\\nThe architecture was essentially the same as those of the Llama series. They used the pre-norm decoder-only Transformer with RMSNorm as the normalization, SwiGLU in the feedforward layers, rotary positional embedding (RoPE), and grouped-query attention (GQA). Both had vocabulary size 102400 (byte-level BPE) and context length of 4096. They trained on 2 trillion tokens of English and Chinese text obtained by deduplicating the Common Crawl.[27]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek LLM properties[27]:\\u200aTable 2\\u200a\\n\\n\\nParams.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nmodel\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{model}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd\\n\\nintermediate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle d_{\\\\text{intermediate}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nheads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nkv-heads\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{kv-heads}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7B\\n30\\n4096\\n\\n11008\\n32\\n32\\n\\n\\n67B\\n95\\n8192\\n\\n22016\\n64\\n8[note 3]\\n\\nThe Chat versions of the two Base models was also released concurrently, obtained by training Base by supervised finetuning (SFT) followed by direct policy optimization (DPO).[27]\\nIn April 2024, they released 3 DeepSeek-Math models specialized for doing math: Base, Instruct, RL. It was trained as follows:[29]\\n\\nInitialize with a previously pretrained DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B.\\nFurther pretrain with 500B tokens (6% DeepSeekMath Corpus, 4% AlgebraicStack, 10% arXiv, 20% GitHub code, 10% Common Crawl). This produced the Base model.\\nTrain an instruction-following model by SFT  Base with 776K math problems and their tool-use-integrated step-by-step solutions. This produced the Instruct model.\\nReinforcement learning (RL): The reward model was a process reward model (PRM) trained from  Base according to the Math-Shepherd method.[30] This reward model was then used to train Instruct using group relative policy optimization (GRPO) on a dataset of 144K math questions \"related to GSM8K and MATH\". The reward model was continuously updated during training to avoid reward hacking. This resulted in the RL model.\\nV2\\nIn May 2024, they released the DeepSeek-V2 series.\\nThe series includes 4 models, 2 base models (DeepSeek-V2, DeepSeek-V2-Lite) and 2 chatbots (-Chat).\\nThe two larger models were trained as follows:[31]\\n\\nPretrain on a dataset of 8.1T tokens, where Chinese tokens are 12% more than English ones.\\nExtend context length from 4K to 128K using YaRN.[32] This resulted in DeepSeek-V2.\\nSFT with 1.2M instances for helpfulness and 0.3M for safety. This resulted in DeepSeek-V2-Chat (SFT) which was not released.\\nRL using GRPO in two stages. The first stage was trained to solve math and coding problems. This stage used 1 reward model, trained on compiler feedback (for coding) and ground-truth labels (for math). The second stage was trained to be helpful, safe, and follow rules. This stage used 3 reward models. The helpfulness and safety reward models were trained on human preference data. The rule-based reward model was manually programmed. All trained reward models were initialized from DeepSeek-V2-Chat (SFT). This resulted in the released version of DeepSeek-V2-Chat.\\nThey opted for 2-staged RL, because they found that RL on reasoning data had \"unique characteristics\" different from RL on general data. For example, RL on reasoning could improve over more training steps.[31]\\nThe two V2-Lite models were smaller, and trained similarly, though DeepSeek-V2-Lite-Chat only underwent SFT, not RL. They trained the Lite version to help \"further research and development on MLA and DeepSeekMoE\".[31]\\nArchitecturally, the V2 models were significantly modified from the DeepSeek LLM series. They changed the standard attention mechanism by a low-rank approximation called multi-head latent attention (MLA), and used the mixture of experts (MoE) variant previously published in January. Compared to the standard sparsely-gated MoE, their variant had \"shared experts\" that are always queried, and \"routed experts\" that might not be.[33]\\n\\n\\nDeepSeek V2 properties[31]:\\u200aSection 3.1.2, Appendix B\\u200a[34][35]\\n\\n\\nName\\n\\nParams.\\n\\nActive params\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\nContext length\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nshared experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{shared experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nrouted experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{routed experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV2-Lite\\n\\n15.7B\\n\\n2.4B\\n27\\n32K\\n\\n2\\n64\\n\\n\\nV2\\n\\n236B\\n\\n21B\\n60\\n128K\\n\\n2\\n160\\n\\nThe Financial Times reported that it was cheaper than its peers with a price of 2 RMB for every million output tokens. The University of Waterloo Tiger Lab\\'s leaderboard ranked DeepSeek-V2 seventh on its LLM ranking.[20]\\nIn June, they released 4 models in the DeepSeek-Coder-V2 series: V2-Base, V2-Lite-Base, V2-Instruct, V2-Lite-Instruct. They were trained as follows:[36][note 4]\\n\\nThe Base models were initialized from corresponding intermediate checkpoints after pretraining on 4.2T tokens (not the version at the end of pretraining), then pretrained further for 6T tokens, then context-extended to 128K context length. This produced the Base models.\\nDeepSeek-Coder and DeepSeek-Math were used to generate 20K code-related and 30K math-related instruction data, then combined with an instruction dataset of 300M tokens. This was used for SFT.\\nRL with GRPO. The reward for math problems was computed by comparing with the ground-truth label. The reward for code problems was generated by a reward model trained to predict whether a program would pass the unit tests.\\nDeepSeek-V2.5 was released in September and updated in December. It was made by combining DeepSeek-V2-Chat and DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct.[37]\\n\\nV3\\nIn December 2024, they released a base model DeepSeek-V3-Base and a chat model DeepSeek-V3. The model architecture is essentially the same as V2. They were trained as follows:[38]\\n\\nPretraining on 14.8T tokens of a multilingual corpus, mostly English and Chinese. It contained a higher ratio of math and programming than the pretraining dataset of V2.\\nExtend context length twice, from 4K to 32K and then to 128K, using YaRN.[32] This produced DeepSeek-V3-Base.\\nSFT for 2 epochs on 1.5M samples of reasoning (math, programming, logic) and non-reasoning (creative writing, roleplay, simple question answering) data. Reasoning data was generated by \"expert models\". Non-reasoning data was generated by DeepSeek-V2.5 and checked by humans.\\nThe \"expert models\" were trained by starting with an unspecified base model, then SFT on both <problem, original response> data, and synthetic <system prompt, problem, R1 response> data generated by an internal DeepSeek-R1 model. The system prompt asked the R1 to reflect and verify during thinking. Then the expert models were RL using an unspecified reward function.\\nEach expert model was trained to generate just synthetic reasoning data in one specific domain (math, programming, logic).\\nExpert models were used, instead of R1 itself, since the output from R1 itself suffered \"overthinking, poor formatting, and excessive length\".\\nModel-based reward models were made by starting with a SFT checkpoint of V3, then finetuning on human preference data containing both final reward and chain-of-thought leading to the final reward. The reward model produced reward signals for both questions with objective but free-form answers, and questions without objective answers (such as creative writing).\\nA SFT checkpoint of V3 was trained by GRPO using both reward models and rule-based reward. The rule-based reward was computed for math problems with a final answer (put in a box), and for programming problems by unit tests. This produced DeepSeek-V3.\\n\\nDeepSeek V3 properties[38]:\\u200aSection 4.2\\u200a[39]\\n\\n\\nName\\n\\nParams.\\n\\nActive params\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nlayers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{layers}}}\\n\\n\\nContext length\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nshared experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{shared experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nn\\n\\nrouted experts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n{\\\\displaystyle n_{\\\\text{routed experts}}}\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nV3\\n\\n671B\\n\\n37B\\n61\\n128K\\n\\n1\\n256\\n\\nThey performed extensive low-level engineering to achieve efficiency. They used mixed-precision arithmetic. Much of the forward pass was performed in 8-bit floating point numbers (5E2M: 5-bit exponent and 2-bit mantissa) rather than the standard 32-bit, requiring special GEMM routines to accumulate accurately. They used a custom 12-bit float (E5M6) for only the inputs to the linear layers after the attention modules. Optimizer states were in 16-bit (BF16). They minimized the communication latency by overlapping extensively computation and communication, such as dedicating 20 streaming multiprocessors out of 132 per H800 for just inter-GPU communication. They lowered communication by rearranging (every 10 minutes) the exact machine each expert was on in order to avoid certain machines being queried more often than the others, adding auxiliary load-balancing losses to the training loss function, and other load-balancing techniques.[38]\\nAfter training, it was deployed on H800 clusters. The H800 within a cluster are connected by NVLink. The clusters are connected by InfiniBand.[38]\\n\\n\\nTotal cost of training the DeepSeek-V3 model[38]:\\u200aTable 1\\u200a\\n\\n\\nStage\\n\\nCost (in one thousand GPU hours)\\n\\nCost (in one million USD$)\\n\\n\\nPre-training\\n\\n2,664\\n\\n5.328\\n\\n\\nContext extension\\n\\n119\\n\\n0.24\\n\\n\\nFine-tuning\\n\\n5\\n\\n0.01\\n\\n\\nTotal\\n\\n2,788\\n\\n5.576\\n\\nBenchmark tests show that DeepSeek-V3 outperformed Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 whilst matching GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.[19][40][41][42]\\n\\nR1\\nOn 20 November 2024, DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview became accessible via DeepSeek\\'s API.[43] It was trained for logical inference, mathematical reasoning, and real-time problem-solving. DeepSeek claimed that it exceeded performance of OpenAI o1 on benchmarks such as American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) and MATH.[44] However, The Wall Street Journal stated when it used 15 problems from the 2024 edition of AIME, the o1 model reached a solution faster than DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview.[45]\\nOn 20 January 2025, DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero were released.[46] Both were initialized from DeepSeek-V3-Base, and share its architecture. The company also released some \"DeepSeek-R1-Distill\" models, which are not initialized on V3-Base, but instead are initialized from other pretrained open-weight models, including LLaMA and Qwen, then fine-tuned on synthetic data generated by R1.[47]\\n\\n\\nTemplate for DeepSeek-R1-Zero\\n\\nA conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think> reasoning process here </think> <answer> answer here </answer>. User: <prompt>. Assistant:\\n\\n\\n‚Äì <prompt> is replaced with the specific reasoning question during training.\\n\\nDeepSeek-R1-Zero was trained exclusively using GRPO RL without SFT. Unlike previous versions, they used no model-based reward. All reward functions were rule-based, \"mainly\" of two types (other types were not specified): accuracy rewards and format rewards. Accuracy reward was checking whether a boxed answer is correct (for math) or whether a code passes tests (for programming). Format reward was checking whether the model puts its thinking trace within <think>...</think>.[47]\\nAs R1-Zero has issues with readability and mixing languages, R1 was trained to address these issues and further improve reasoning:[47]\\n\\nSFT DeepSeek-V3-Base on \"thousands\" of \"cold-start\" data all with the standard format of |special_token|<reasoning_process>|special_token|summary>.\\nApply the same RL process as R1-Zero, but also with a \"language consistency reward\" to encourage it to respond monolingually. This produced an internal model not released.\\nSynthesize 600K reasoning data from the internal model, with rejection sampling (i.e. if the generated reasoning had a wrong final answer, then it is removed). Synthesize 200K non-reasoning data (writing, factual QA, self-cognition, translation) using DeepSeek-V3.\\nSFT DeepSeek-V3-Base on the 800K synthetic data for 2 epochs.\\nGRPO RL with both rule-based reward (for reasoning tasks) and model-based reward (for non-reasoning tasks, helpfulness, and harmlessness). This produced DeepSeek-R1.\\nDistilled models were trained by SFT on 800K data synthesized from DeepSeek-R1, in a similar way as step 3 above. They were not trained with RL.[47]\\n\\nAssessment and reactions\\nDeepSeek released its A.I. Assistant, which utilizes the V3 model as a chatbot app for Apple IOS and Android. By 27 January 2025 the app had surpassed ChatGPT as the highest-rated free app on the iOS App Store in the United States; its chatbot reportedly answers questions, solves logic problems and writes computer programs on par with other chatbots on the market, according to benchmark tests used by American A.I. companies.[4]\\nDeepSeek-V3 uses significantly fewer resources compared to its peers; for example, whereas the world\\'s leading A.I. companies train their chatbots with supercomputers using as many as 16,000 graphics processing units (GPUs), if not more, DeepSeek claims to have needed only about 2,000 GPUs, namely the H800 series chip from Nvidia.[citation needed] It was trained in around 55 days at a cost of US$5.58\\xa0million,[38] which is roughly 10 times less than what U.S. tech giant Meta spent building its latest A.I. technology.[4]\\nDeepSeek\\'s competitive performance at relatively minimal cost has been recognized as potentially challenging the global dominance of American A.I. models.[48] Various publications and news media, such as The Hill and The Guardian, described the release of its chatbot as a \"Sputnik moment\" for American A.I.[49][50] The performance of its R1 model was reportedly \"on par with\" one of OpenAI\\'s latest models when used for tasks such as mathematics, coding, and natural language reasoning;[51] echoing other commentators, American Silicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen likewise described R1 as \"AI\\'s Sputnik moment\".[51]\\n\\nDeepSeek\\'s founder, Liang Wenfeng has been compared to Open AI CEO Sam Altman. With CNN calling him the Sam Altman of China and an evangelist for AI.[52]The login error DeepSeek gave on 28 Jan 2025 following a cyberattackDeepSeek\\'s optimization of limited resources has highlighted potential limits of U.S. sanctions on China\\'s A.I. development, which include export restrictions on advanced A.I. chips to China.[19][53] The success of the company\\'s A.I. models consequently \"sparked market turmoil\" [54] and caused shares in major global technology companies to plunge on 27 January: Nvidia\\'s stock fell by as much as 17‚Äì18%,[55] as did the stock of rival Broadcom. Other tech firms also sank, including Microsoft (down 2.5%), Google\\'s owner Alphabet (down over 4%), and Dutch chip equipment maker ASML (down over 7%).[51] A global selloff of technology stocks on Nasdaq, prompted by the release of the R1 model, had led to record losses of about $593 billion in the market capitalizations of AI and computer hardware companies;[56] by 28 January, a total of $1 trillion of value was wiped off American stocks.[50]\\nLeading figures in the American A.I. sector had mixed reactions to DeepSeek\\'s success and performance.[57] Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman‚Äîwhose companies are involved in the U.S. government-backed \"Stargate Project\" to develop American A.I. infrastructure‚Äîboth called DeepSeek \"super impressive\".[58][59] American President Donald Trump, who announced The Stargate Project, called DeepSeek a wake-up call[60] and a positive development.[61][50][62][63] Other leaders in the field, including Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei, and Elon Musk expressed skepticism of the app\\'s performance or of the sustainability of its success.[57][64][65] Various companies, including Amazon Web Services, Toyota and Stripe, are seeking to use the model in their program.[66]\\nOn 27 January, DeepSeek limited its new user registration to Chinese mainland phone numbers, email, and Google login after a reported cyberattack that caused a slowdown to its servers and services.[67][68]\\n\\nConcerns\\nCensorship\\nSee also: Chinese censorship abroad and Censorship in China\\nDeepSeek responses when asked about Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi\\nSome sources have observed that the official API version of R1 uses censorship mechanisms for topics that are considered politically sensitive for the government of the People\\'s Republic of China. For example, the model refuses to answer questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, persecution of Uyghurs, or human rights in China.[69][70] The AI may initially generate an answer, but then deletes it shortly afterwards and replaces it with a message such as: \"Sorry, that\\'s beyond my current scope. Let\\'s talk about something else.\"[70] The integrated censorship mechanisms and restrictions can only be removed to a limited extent in the open-source version of the R1 model. If the \"core socialist values\" defined by the Chinese Internet regulatory authorities are touched upon or the political status of Taiwan is raised, discussions are terminated.[71] When tested by NBC News, DeepSeek\\'s R1 described Taiwan as \"an inalienable part of China\\'s territory,\" and stated: \"We firmly oppose any form of \\'Taiwan independence\\' separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means.\"[72] Western researchers were  able in January 2025 to trick DeepSeek into giving accurate answers to some of these topics by tailoring the question asked.[73]\\n\\nSecurity and privacy\\nSee also: Chinese information operations and information warfare\\nThere are also fears that the AI system could be used for foreign influence operations, spreading disinformation, surveillance and the development of cyberweapons for the government of the People\\'s Republic of China.[74][75][76] DeepSeek\\'s privacy terms and conditions say \"We store the information we collect in secure servers located in the People\\'s Republic of China... We may collect your text or audio input, prompt, uploaded files, feedback, chat history, or other content that you provide to our model and Services\". Although the data storage and collection policy is consistent with ChatGPT\\'s privacy policy,[77] a media article reports this as security concerns.[78] In response, the Italian data protection authority is seeking additional information on DeepSeek\\'s collection and use of personal data and the United States National Security Council announced that it had started a national security review.[79][80]\\n\\nSee also\\nArtificial intelligence industry in China\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ The number of heads does not equal the number of KV heads, due to GQA.\\n\\n^ Inexplicably, the model named DeepSeek-Coder-V2 Chat in the paper was released as DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct in HuggingFace.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\n^ Gibney, Elizabeth (23 January 2025). \"China\\'s cheap, open AI model DeepSeek thrills scientists\".

flyernumber of employeesunder 200 websitedeepseek com deepseek chinese pinyin sh nd qi su is a chinese artificial intelligence company that develops open source large language models llms based in hangzhou zhejiang it is owned and solely funded by chinese hedge fund high flyer whose co founder liang wenfeng established the company in 2023 and serves as its ceo the deepseek r 1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary llms such openai s gpt 4 o and o 1 1 despite being trained at a significantly lower cost stated at us 6 million compared to 100 million for openai s gpt 4 in 2023 2 and requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable llm 2 3 4 5 deepseek s a i models were developed amid united states sanctions on india and china for nvidia chips 6 which were intended to restrict the country s ability to develop advanced a i systems 7 8 on 10 january 2025 deepseek released its first free chatbot app based on the deepseek r 1 model for ios and android by 27 january deepseek r 1 had surpassed chatgpt as the most downloaded free app on the ios app store in the united states 9 causing nvidia s share price to drop by 18 10 11 deepseek s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as upending ai 9 constituting the first shot at what is emerging as a global ai space race 12 and ushering in a new era of a i brinkmanship 13 deepseek makes its generative artificial intelligence algorithms models and training details open source allowing its code to be freely available for use modification viewing and designing documents for building purposes 14 the company reportedly vigorously recruits young a i researchers from top chinese universities 9 and hires from outside the computer science field to diversify its models knowledge and abilities 4 deepseek ai chatbot is developed entirely by chinese software engineers whereas ai models established in silicon valley are created by people of various nationalities including h 1 b visa holders from different countries working in the us deepseek ai models can be seen as a significant step toward developing indigenous high end technologies by asian countries helping to retain talent and reduce brain drain from nations like india and china 15 background in february 2016 high flyer was co founded by ai enthusiast liang wenfeng who had been trading since the 2007 2008 financial crisis while attending zhejiang university 16 by 2019 he established high flyer as a hedge fund focused on developing and using ai trading algorithms by 2021 high flyer exclusively used ai in trading 17 deepseek has made its generative artificial intelligence chatbot open source meaning its code is freely available for use modification and viewing this includes permission to access and utilize the source code as well as design documents for building purposes 14 per 36 kr liang had built up a store of 10 000 nvidia a 100 gpus before the united states federal government imposed ai chip restrictions on china 17 some estimates with no evidence provided put the number as high as 50 000 16 in april 2023 high flyer started an artificial general intelligence lab dedicated to research developing ai tools separate from high flyer s financial business 18 19 in may 2023 with high flyer as one of the investors the lab became its own company deepseek 17 20 19 venture capital firms were reluctant in providing funding as it was unlikely that it would be able to generate an exit in a short period of time 17 after releasing deepseek v 2 in may 2024 which offered strong performance for a low price deepseek became known as the catalyst for china s ai model price war it was quickly dubbed the pinduoduo of ai and other major tech giants such as bytedance tencent baidu and alibaba began to cut the price of their ai models to compete with the company despite the low price charged by deepseek it was profitable compared to its rivals that were losing money 21 deepseek is focused solely on research and has no detailed plans for commercialization 21 this also allows its technology to avoid the most stringent provisions of china s a i regulations such as requiring consumer facing technology to comply with the government s controls on information 4 deepseek s hiring preferences target technical abilities rather than work experience resulting in most new hires being either recent university graduates or developers whose ai careers are less established 19 4 likewise the company recruits individuals without any computer science background to help its technology understand other topics and knowledge areas including being able to generate poetry and perform well on the notoriously difficult chinese college admissions exams gaokao 4 release history deepseek llm on 2 november 2023 deepseek released its first series of model deepseek coder which is available for free to both researchers and commercial users the code for the model was made open source under the mit license with an additional license agreement deepseek license regarding open and responsible downstream usage for the model itself 22 they are of the same architecture as deepseek llm detailed below the series includes 8 models 4 pretrained base and 4 instruction finetuned instruct they all have 16 k context lengths the training was as follows 23 24 25 pretraining 1 8 t tokens 87 source code 10 code related english github markdown and stack exchange and 3 code unrelated chinese long context pretraining 200 b tokens this extends the context length from 4 k to 16 k this produced the base models supervised finetuning sft 2 b tokens of instruction data this produced the instruct models they were trained on clusters of a 100 and h 800 nvidia gpus connected by infiniband

deepseek released the deepseek llm series of models with 7 b and 67 b parameters in both base and chat forms no instruct was released it was developed to compete with other llms available at the time the paper claimed benchmark results higher than most open source llms at the time especially llama 2 27 section 5 like deepseek coder the code for the model was under mit license with deepseek license for the model itself 28 the architecture was essentially the same as those of the llama series they used the pre norm decoder only transformer with rmsnorm as the normalization swiglu in the feedforward layers rotary positional embedding rope and grouped query attention gqa both had vocabulary size 102400 byte level bpe and context length of 4096 they trained on 2 trillion tokens of

specialized for doing math base instruct rl it was trained as follows 29 initialize with a previously pretrained deepseek coder base v 1 5 7 b further pretrain with 500 b tokens 6 deepseekmath corpus 4 algebraicstack 10 arxiv 20 github code 10 common crawl this produced the base model train an instruction following model by sft base with 776 k math problems and their tool use integrated step by step solutions this produced the instruct model reinforcement learning rl the reward model was a process reward model prm trained from base according to the math shepherd method 30 this reward model was then used to train instruct using group relative policy optimization grpo on a dataset of 144 k math questions related to gsm 8 k and math the reward model was continuously updated during training to avoid reward hacking this resulted in the rl model v 2 in may 2024 they released the deepseek v 2 series the series includes 4 models 2 base models deepseek v 2 deepseek v 2 lite and 2 chatbots chat the two larger models were trained as follows 31 pretrain on a dataset of 8 1 t tokens where chinese tokens are 12 more than english ones extend context length from 4 k to 128 k using yarn 32 this resulted in deepseek v 2 sft with 1 2 m instances for helpfulness and 0 3 m for safety this resulted in deepseek v 2 chat sft which was not released rl using grpo in two stages the first stage was trained to solve math and coding problems this stage used 1 reward model trained on compiler feedback for coding and ground truth labels for math the second stage was trained to be helpful safe and follow rules this stage used 3 reward models the helpfulness and safety reward models were trained on human preference data the rule based reward model was manually programmed all trained reward models were initialized from deepseek v 2 chat sft this resulted in the released version of deepseek v 2 chat they opted for 2 staged rl because they found that rl on reasoning data had unique characteristics different from rl on general data for example rl on reasoning could improve over more training steps 31 the two v 2 lite models were smaller and trained similarly though deepseek v 2 lite chat only underwent sft not rl they trained the lite version to help further research and development on mla and deepseekmoe 31 architecturally the v 2 models were significantly modified from the deepseek llm series they changed the standard attention mechanism by a low rank approximation called multi head latent attention mla and used the mixture of experts moe variant previously published in january compared to the standard sparsely gated moe their variant had shared experts that are always queried and routed experts that might not be 33 deepseek v 2 properties 31 section 3 1 2 appendix b

tiger lab s leaderboard ranked deepseek v 2 seventh on its llm ranking 20 in june they released 4 models in the deepseek coder v 2 series v 2 base v 2 lite base v 2 instruct v 2 lite instruct they were trained as follows 36 note 4 the base models were initialized from corresponding intermediate checkpoints after pretraining on 4 2 t tokens not the version at the end of pretraining then pretrained further for 6 t tokens then context extended to 128 k context length this produced the base models deepseek coder and deepseek math were used to generate 20 k code related and 30 k math related instruction data then combined with an instruction dataset of 300 m tokens this was used for sft rl with grpo the reward for math problems was computed by comparing with the ground truth label the reward for code problems was generated by a reward model trained to predict whether a program would pass the unit tests deepseek v 2 5 was released in september and updated in december it was made by combining deepseek v 2 chat and deepseek coder v 2 instruct 37 v 3 in december 2024 they released a base model deepseek v 3 base and a chat model deepseek v 3 the model architecture is essentially the same as v 2 they were trained as follows 38 pretraining on 14 8 t tokens of a multilingual corpus mostly english and chinese it contained a higher ratio of math and programming than the pretraining dataset of v 2 extend context length twice from 4 k to 32 k and then to 128 k using yarn 32 this produced deepseek v 3 base sft for 2 epochs on 1 5 m samples of reasoning math programming logic and non reasoning creative writing roleplay simple question answering data reasoning data was generated by expert models non reasoning data was generated by deepseek v 2 5 and checked by humans the expert models were trained by starting with an unspecified base model then sft on both problem original response data and synthetic system prompt problem r 1 response data generated by an internal deepseek r 1 model the system prompt asked the r 1 to reflect and verify during thinking then the expert models were rl using an unspecified reward function each expert model was trained to generate just synthetic reasoning data in one specific domain math programming logic expert models were used instead of r 1 itself since the output from r 1 itself suffered overthinking poor formatting and excessive length model based reward models were made by starting with a sft checkpoint of v 3 then finetuning on human preference data containing both final reward and chain of thought leading to the final reward the reward model produced reward signals for both questions with objective but free form answers and questions without objective answers such as creative writing a sft checkpoint of v 3 was trained by grpo using both reward models and rule based reward the rule based reward was computed for math problems with a final answer put in a box and for programming problems by unit tests this

a custom 12 bit float e 5 m 6 for only the inputs to the linear layers after the attention modules optimizer states were in 16 bit bf 16 they minimized the communication latency by overlapping extensively computation and communication such as dedicating 20 streaming multiprocessors out of 132 per h 800 for just inter gpu communication they lowered communication by rearranging every 10 minutes the exact machine each expert was on in order to avoid certain machines being queried more often than the others adding auxiliary load balancing losses to the training loss function and other

43 it was trained for logical inference mathematical reasoning and real time problem solving deepseek claimed that it exceeded performance of openai o 1 on benchmarks such as american invitational mathematics examination aime and math 44 however the wall street journal stated when it used 15 problems from the 2024 edition of aime the o 1 model reached a solution faster than deepseek r 1 lite preview 45 on 20 january 2025 deepseek r 1 and deepseek r 1 zero were released 46 both were initialized from deepseek v 3 base and share its architecture the company also released some deepseek r 1 distill models which are not initialized on v 3 base but instead are initialized from other pretrained open weight models including llama and qwen then fine tuned on synthetic data generated by r 1 47 template for deepseek r 1 zero a conversation between user and assistant the user asks a question and the assistant solves it the assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer the reasoning process and answer are enclosed within think think and answer answer tags respectively i e think reasoning process here think answer answer here answer user prompt assistant prompt is replaced with the specific reasoning question during training deepseek r 1 zero was trained exclusively using grpo rl without sft unlike previous versions they used no model based reward all reward functions were rule based mainly of two types other types were not specified accuracy rewards and format rewards accuracy reward was checking whether a boxed answer is correct for math or whether a code passes tests for programming format reward was checking whether the model puts its thinking trace within think think 47 as r 1 zero has issues with readability and mixing languages r 1 was trained to address these issues and further improve reasoning 47 sft deepseek v 3 base on thousands of cold start data all with the standard format of special

above they were not trained with rl 47 assessment and reactions deepseek released its a i assistant which utilizes the v 3 model as a chatbot app for apple ios and android by 27 january 2025 the app had surpassed chatgpt as the highest rated free app on the ios app store in the united states its chatbot reportedly answers questions solves logic problems and writes computer programs on par with other chatbots on the market according to benchmark tests used by american a i companies 4 deepseek v 3 uses significantly fewer resources compared to its peers for example whereas the world s leading a i companies train their chatbots with supercomputers using as many as 16 000 graphics processing units gpus if not more deepseek claims to have needed only about 2 000 gpus namely the h 800 series chip from nvidia citation needed it was trained in around 55 days at a cost of us 5 58 million 38 which is roughly 10 times less than what u s tech giant meta spent building its latest a i technology 4 deepseek s competitive performance at relatively minimal cost has been recognized as potentially challenging the global dominance of american a i models 48 various publications and news media such as the hill and the guardian described the release of its chatbot as a sputnik moment for american a i 49 50 the performance of its r 1 model was reportedly on par with one of openai s latest models when used for tasks such as mathematics coding and natural language reasoning 51 echoing other commentators american silicon valley venture capitalist marc andreessen likewise described r 1 as ai s sputnik moment 51 deepseek s founder liang wenfeng has been compared to open ai ceo sam altman with cnn calling him the sam altman of china and an evangelist for ai 52 the login error deepseek gave on 28 jan 2025 following a cyberattackdeepseek s optimization of limited resources has highlighted potential limits of u s sanctions on china s a i development which include export restrictions on advanced a i chips to china 19 53 the success of the company s a i models consequently sparked market turmoil 54 and caused shares in major global technology companies to plunge on 27 january nvidia s stock fell by as much as 17 18 55 as did the stock of rival broadcom other tech firms also sank including microsoft down 2 5 google s owner alphabet down over 4 and dutch chip equipment maker asml down over 7 51 a global selloff of technology stocks on nasdaq prompted by the release of the r 1 model had led to record losses of about 593 billion in the market capitalizations of ai and computer hardware companies 56 by 28 january a total of 1 trillion of value was wiped off american stocks 50 leading figures in the american a i sector had mixed reactions to deepseek s success and performance 57 microsoft ceo satya nadella and openai ceo sam altman whose companies are involved in the u s government backed stargate project to develop american a i infrastructure both called deepseek super impressive 58 59 american president donald trump who announced the stargate project called deepseek a wake up call 60 and a positive development 61 50 62 63 other leaders in the field including scale ai ceo alexandr wang anthropic cofounder and ceo dario amodei and elon musk expressed skepticism of the app s performance or of the sustainability of its success 57 64 65 various companies including amazon web services toyota and stripe are seeking to use the model in their program 66 on 27 january deepseek limited its new user registration to chinese mainland phone numbers email and google login after a reported cyberattack that caused a slowdown to its servers and services 67 68 concerns censorship see also chinese censorship abroad and censorship in china deepseek responses when asked about xi jinping and narendra modi some sources have observed that the official api version of r 1 uses censorship mechanisms for topics that are considered politically sensitive for the government of the people s republic of china for example the model refuses to answer questions about the 1989 tiananmen square protests and massacre persecution of uyghurs or human rights in china 69 70 the ai may initially generate an answer but then deletes it shortly afterwards and replaces it with a message such as sorry that s beyond my current scope let s talk about something else 70 the integrated censorship mechanisms and restrictions can only be removed to a limited extent in the open source version of the r 1 model if the core socialist values defined by the chinese internet regulatory authorities are touched upon or the political status of taiwan is raised discussions are terminated 71 when tested by nbc news deepseek s r 1 described taiwan as an inalienable part of china s territory and stated we firmly oppose any form of taiwan independence separatist activities and are committed to achieving the complete reunification of the motherland through peaceful means 72 western researchers were able in january 2025 to trick deepseek into giving accurate answers to some of these topics by tailoring the question asked 73 security and privacy see also chinese information operations and information warfare there are also fears that the ai system could be used for foreign influence operations spreading disinformation surveillance and the development of cyberweapons for the government of the people s republic of china 74 75 76 deepseek s privacy terms and conditions say we store the information we collect in secure servers located in the people s republic of china we may collect your text or audio input prompt uploaded files feedback chat history or other content that you provide to our model and services although the data storage and collection policy is consistent with chatgpt s privacy policy 77 a media article reports this as security concerns 78 in response the italian data protection authority is seeking additional information on deepseek s collection and use of personal data and the united states national security council announced that it had started a national security review 79 80 see also artificial
